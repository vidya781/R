The heart of R programming consists in writing functions. A function is a group of instructions that takes inputs, uses them to compute
other values and then returns a result.
Here we define a function called oddcount() whose purpose is to count the odd numbers in a vector of integers.
Also we define a function called evencount() whose purpose is to count the even numbers in a vector of integers. It is now clear that all tnat 
needs to be changed is the simple function inside the brackets


oddcount<- function(x){}
> oddcount <- function(x){
+     k <- 0 # assign 0 to k
+     for (n in x) {
+         if(n %% 2 == 1) k <- k + 1 # %% is modulo operator
+     }
+     return(k)
+ }
> oddcount(c(1,2,3,7,9))

 evencount <- function(x){}
> evencount <- function(x){
+     k <- 0 # assign 0 to k
+     for(n in x){
+         if(n %%2 == 0) k <- k + 1 
+     }
+     return(k)
+ }
